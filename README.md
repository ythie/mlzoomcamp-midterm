In this project, I develop a model to predict solar irradiation based on factors such as temperature, pressure, humidity,
wind direction and speed. The dataset comes from a Kaggle dataset https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/dronio/SolarEnergy. Knowing
factors that contribute to the intensity of solar irradiation enable us to predict the best way to utilize solar energy.
